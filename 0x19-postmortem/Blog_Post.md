# Issue Summary:

* Duration: April 10, 2024, 09:00 UTC to April 11, 2024, 01:00 UTC
* Impact: The file storage service had a brief existential crisis, experiencing intermittent outages that left 35% of users feeling a bit lost. Users encountered slow response times and occasional service unavailability, prompting some to contemplate the meaning of digital life.
* Root Cause: A mischievous misconfiguration in the load balancer decided to play favorites, directing all the traffic to one lonely backend server, leading to its inevitable meltdown.
# Timeline:

* April 10, 2024, 09:15 UTC: Our monitoring system, acting as the ever-vigilant watchdog, detected increased latency and error rates, alerting us to trouble in paradise.
* April 10, 2024, 09:20 UTC: The engineering team sprang into action like caped crusaders, ready to rescue our distressed service from the clutches of chaos.
* April 10, 2024, 09:30 UTC: Initially, we suspected a diabolical DDoS attack, but upon closer inspection, the culprit turned out to be our own mischievous misconfiguration.
* April 10, 2024, 10:00 UTC: Like intrepid detectives, we scoured the network infrastructure for signs of foul play, only to find it was a case of mistaken identity.
* April 10, 2024, 11:30 UTC: With our tails between our legs, we reluctantly escalated the incident to the wise elders of senior engineering management.
* April 10, 2024, 13:45 UTC: The root cause finally revealed itself like a magician unveiling a long-lost rabbit â€“ a misconfigured load balancer playing favorites with our backend servers.
* April 10, 2024, 15:00 UTC: Armed with the knowledge of our mischievous misconfiguration, we swiftly corrected the load balancer settings to distribute traffic evenly, restoring harmony to our digital realm.
* April 10, 2024, 17:30 UTC: Order was restored, and our file storage service emerged from its existential crisis, ready to face the digital wilderness once more.
# Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was traced back to a mischievous misconfiguration in the load balancer, which decided to play favorites with our backend servers, causing one to buckle under the weight of all the attention.

To resolve the issue, we gave the load balancer a stern talking-to and adjusted its settings to evenly distribute traffic among all backend servers. Additionally, we reinforced our monitoring systems to promptly catch any future attempts at mischief.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

* Improvements/Fixes:
  * Implement regular load balancer configuration audits to keep it from getting any more funny ideas.
  * Enhance monitoring systems to catch misconfigurations before they wreak havoc.
* Tasks:
  * Conduct load balancer sensitivity training sessions to ensure it understands the importance of fairness.
  * Develop automated tests to simulate various traffic scenarios and prevent future misconfigurations from slipping through the cracks.

By taking these measures, we hope to keep our digital realm running smoothly and avoid any further existential crises. After all, even servers need a little TLC now and then!
